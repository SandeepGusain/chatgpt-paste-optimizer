# ChatGPT Paste Optimizer

> **Manage large text pastes in ChatGPT like a pro.**  
> Automatically converts large code/text blocks into editable file attachments, keeping your chat clean.

## Features
*   **Clean UI:** Pasting 500 lines of code no longer explodes your input box.
*   **Editable Preview:** Fix typos in your code snippet *before* sending it to the AI.
*   **Safe:** Runs 100% locally. No data leaves your browser.

## How to Install (Chrome / Edge / Brave)

Since this is an open-source tool, you install it manually:

1.  **Download:** Click the green **Code** button above -> **Download ZIP**.
2.  **Unzip:** Extract the folder to a safe place (e.g., your Documents folder).
3.  **Open Extensions:**
    *   In Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions`
    *   In Edge, go to `edge://extensions`
4.  **Enable Developer Mode:** Toggle the switch in the top-right corner.
5.  **Load:** Click **"Load unpacked"** and select the folder you just unzipped.

That's it! The extension is now active on chatgpt.com.
